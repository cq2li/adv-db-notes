	abstract="We present a new class of resizable sequential and concurrent hash map algorithms directed at both uni-processor and multicore machines. The new hopscotch algorithms are based on a novel hopscotch multi-phased probing and displacement technique that has the flavors of chaining, cuckoo hashing, and linear probing, all put together, yet avoids the limitations and overheads of these former approaches. The resulting algorithms provide tables with very low synchronization overheads and high cache hit ratios.",
