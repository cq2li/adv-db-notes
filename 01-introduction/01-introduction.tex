\section{Course Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learn about modern practices in database internals and systems programming
    \item Students will become proficient in
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Writing correct + performant code
        \item Proper documentation + testing
        \item Code reviews
        \item Working on a large code base
    \end{itemize}
    \item Course will be focused on only \textbf{single node} systems
    \item Will cover state-of-the-art topics, not classic DBMSs
\end{itemize}

\section{Database History Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stonebreaker says a lot of the issues relevant a long time ago are still relevant today
    \item The "SQL vs NoSQL" debate is reminiscent of the "Relational vs CODASYL" debate
\end{itemize}

\section{1960s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First DBMS - IDS
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrated Data Stonebreaker
        \item Developed internally at GE in the early 1960s
        \item GE sold their computing division to Honeywell in 1969
        \item Had a Network Data Model and Tuple-at-a-time queries
    \end{itemize}
    \item CODASYL
    \begin{itemize}
        \item COBOL people got together and proposed a standard for how programs will access a database
        \item Lead by Charles Bachman
        \item Network Data Model made complex queries difficult and was easily corruptable
    \end{itemize}
    \item IBM IMS
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Information Management systems
        \item Early database system developed to keep track of purchase orders for Apollo moon mission
        \item Hierarchical data Model
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Had a lot of duplicate data and no data independence
        \end{itemize}
        \item Programmer-defined physical storage format
        \item Tuple-at-a-time queries
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{1970s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Model
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ted Codd Was mathematician working at IBM Research
        \item Saw developers constantly changing their codebase when changing their database schema
        \item Created Database abstraction to avoid this maintenence
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Store database in simple data structures
            \item Access data through high-level language
            \item Physical storage left up to implementation
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Early implementations of relatinal DBMSs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item System R - IBM Research
        \item INGRES - U.C. Berkeley
        \item Oracle - Larry Ellison
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{1980s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relatiional model wins
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IBM comes out with DB2 in 1983
        \item "SEQUEL" becomes the standard ("SQL")
    \end{itemize}
    \item Many new "enterprise" DBMSs but Oracle wins marketplace
    \item Stonebraker leaves INGRES and creates Postgres
    \item Object Related Databases
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Argued that how people wrote code and how data is stored in a database is different
        \item Avoid "relational object impedance mismatch" by tightly coupling objects and Database
        \item Few of these original DBMSs from the 1980s still exist today
        \item Issues: Performed badly with complex queries and the systems had no standard API
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{1990s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No major advancements in database systems or application workloads
    \item Major Events:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Microsoft forks Sybase and creates SQL Server
        \item MySQL is written as a replacement for mSQL
        \item Postgres gets SQL support
        \item SQLite started in early 2000
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{2000s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All the big players were heavyweight and expensive. Open-source databases were missing important features
    \item Many companies wrote their own custom middleware to scale out database across single-node DBMS instances
    \item Rise of the special purpose OLAP DBMSs - Data Warehouses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Distributed / Shared-Nothing
        \item Relational / SQL
        \item Usually closed-source
        \item Significant performance benefits from using decomposition Storage Model
    \end{itemize}
    \item NoSQL Systems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focus on high-availability and high-scalability
        \item Schemaless
        \item Non-relational data models
        \item No ACID transactions
        \item Custom APIs instead of SQL
        \item Usually open-source
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{2010s}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NewSQL Systems: Provide same performance for OLTP workloads as NoSQL DBMSs without giving up ACID
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relational / SQL
        \item Distributed
        \item Usually closed-srouce
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hybrid Systems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HTAP: Hybrid Transactional-Analytical Processing
        \item Execute fast OLTP like a NewSQL system while also executing complex OLAP queries like a data warehouse system
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Distributed / Shared-Nothing
            \item Relational/SQL
            \item Mixed open/closed-source
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cloud Systems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings were "containerized" versions of existing DBMSs
        \item There are new DBMSs that are designed from scratch explicitly for running in a cloud environment
    \end{itemize}
    \item Specialized Systems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shared Disk
        \item Embedded
        \item Time-Series
        \item Multi model
        \item Blockchain
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
