\section{\dbSys{Microsoft Hekaton}}
Hekaton started as an internal at Microsoft in 2008. The goal was to create new in-memory OLTP 
engine for \dbSys{Microsoft SQL Server} (MSSQL). The project was led by database experts Paul 
Larson and Mike Zwilling. It was important that the new 
engine integrated with \dbSys{MSSQL} ecosystem. It was also necessary that the engine support all 
possible OLTP workloads with predictable performance.

Key Lessons from Hekaton on building a high-performance OLTP DBMS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Use only lock-free data structures. This means no latches, spin locks, or critical 
    sections for indexes, transaction map, memory allocator, garbage collector.
    Not necessarily true for indexes; systems using traditional latching methods for indexing more 
    often than not outperform lock-free implementations.
        
    \item
    Only one single serialization point in the DBMS to get the transaction's begin and commit 
    timestamp using an atomic addition (i.e., compare-and-swap -- CaS). At high parallelism levels 
    this could be a bottleneck. In this case we can improve performance with batching 
    techniques.
\end{itemize}

The Hekaton concurrency control protocol relies on CaS to install new 
versions~\cite{p298-larson}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Each transaction is assigned a timestamp when they begin (\mvccField{BeginTS}) and when they 
    commit (\mvccField{EndTS}). Hekaton uses a special bit for transaction's \mvccField{BeginTS} 
    field to indicate whether it represents an uncommitted transaction.
        
    \item
    Each tuple contains two timestamps that represents their visibility and current state.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\texttt{BEGIN-TS}}:
        The \mvccField{BeginTS} of the active transaction or the \mvccField{EndTS} of the committed 
        transaction that created it.
            
        \item \textbf{\mvccField{END-TS}}:
        The \mvccField{BeginTS} of the active transaction that created the next version or 
        infinity or the \mvccField{EndTS} of the committed transaction that created it
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% \textbf{Speculative Reads}:
Hekaton allows transactions to speculatively read versions of transactions of uncommitted 
transactions. Then checks in validations if the transactions that it read uncommitted data 
committed. The DBMS does not allow speculative write; first transaction to write a new version 
succeeds, subsequent transactions that attempt to write to the same tuple are aborted.

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Transaction State Map
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Transaction State Map}
Global map of all transactions states in the system. Transactions have to consult this map to 
determine the state of a transaction.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{ACTIVE}:
    The transaction is executing read/write operations.
    
    \item \texttt{VALIDATING}:
    The transaction has invoked commit and the DBMS is checking whether it is valid.
    
    \item \texttt{COMMITTED}:
    The transaction is finished, but may not have updated its version's timestamps.
    
    \item \texttt{TERMINATED}:
    The transaction has updated the timestamps for all of the versions that it created.
\end{itemize}

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Transaction Life-Cycle
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Transaction Life-Cycle}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Begin}:
    Get \mvccField{BeginTS}, set state to ACTIVE. The transaction then begins its normal 
    execution for read/write queries. In addition to updating version information, the DBMS
    also tracks each transaction's read set, scan set and write set.
    
    \item \textbf{Pre-Commit}:
    Assign the transaction its \mvccField{EndTS} and set its state in the transaction map to 
    \texttt{VALIDATING}. During validationm the DBMS checks whether the transaction's reads and 
    scans produce the same result (to ensure serializability). If validation passes, then the DBMS 
    writes new versions to redo log.
    
    \item \textbf{Post-Processing}:
    Update the timetamps for the versions that the tranaction either creatred or 
    invalidated. The transaction updates the \mvccField{BeginTS} in new versions, \texttt{CommitTS} 
    in old versions.
    
    \item \textbf{Terminate}:
    Set transaction state to \text{TERMINATED} and remove from map.
\end{enumerate}

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Transaction Meta-Data
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Transaction Meta-Data}
The DBMS maintains additional meta-data about what transactions did during execution.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read Set}:
    Pointers to every version that the transaction read.
    
    \item \textbf{Write Set:}
    Pointers to the versions that the transaction updated (old and new), deleted (old), 
    and inserted (new).
    
    \item \textbf{Scan Set:}
    Stores enough information needed to perform each scan operation.
    
    \item \textbf{Commit Dependencies:}
    List of transactions that are waiting for this transaction to finish.
\end{itemize}

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Transaction Validation
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Transaction Validation}
Hekaton used both optimistic / pessimistic schemes for transactions. Optimistic schemes outperforms 
pessimistic ones as the number of cores and parallelism increase.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimistic Transactions}:
    Check whether a version read is still visible at the 
    end of a transaction. Repeat all index scans to check for phantoms. 

    \item
    \textbf{Pessimistic Transactions}:
    Use shared and exclusive locks on records and buckets. Do 
    not need any validations and use a separate background thread to perform deadlock detection. 
    Under this setting, the DBMS does not need to perform validation.
\end{itemize}
    
The DBMS needs to scan transactions to provide its transactional guarantees.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{First-Writer Wins:}
    The version vector always points to the last committed version. Do not need to check whether 
    write-sets overlap.

    \item \textbf{Read Stability:}
    Check that each version read is still visible as of the end of 
    the transaction.
    
    \item \textbf{Phantom Avoidance:}
    Repeat each scan to check whether new versions have become visible since the transaction began.
    
    \item Extend of validation depends on isolation level:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \isoLevel{SERIALIZABLE}: Read Stability + Phantom Avoidance.
        \item \isoLevel{REPEATABLE READS}: Read Stability.
        \item \isoLevel{SNAPSHOT ISOLATION}: None
        \item \isoLevel{READ COMMITTED}: None
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{\dbSys{HyPer}}
Read/scan set validations are expensive if transactions access a lot of data. Appending new versions 
hurts the performance of OLAP scans due to pointer chasing and branching. Record level conflict 
checks may be too coarse-grained and incur false positives.

\dbSys{HyPer} uses a MVCC implementation that is designed for HTAP workloads~\cite{p677-neumann}. 
It is a column-store with delta record versioning. Avoids write-write conflicts by aborting 
transactions that try to update an uncommitted object.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In-Place updates for non-indexed attributes
    \item Delete/Insert updates for indexed attributes
    \item N2O version chains
    \item No Predicate Locks and No Scan Checks
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Transaction Validation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{First-Writer Wins}
    \item \textbf{Precision 
    Lock:} Compare the committed transaction's write set for phantoms using Precision Locking~\cite{jordan81}. \rr{For each validating transactions, we evaluate its \sql{WHERE} clause based on each delta record of the transactions that are committed \textit{after} the validation has started:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the predicate evaluates to false, we know that particular transaction from the delta storage did not create a version that we should have read.
        \item If the predicate evaluates to true for some transaction's delta record, we know that we should have read the version created by that transaction. We abort our validating transactions and rollback our changes.
    \end{itemize}}
    \item
    Only need to store the transaction's read predicates and not its entire read set.
    \item \rr{Hyper uses single-threaded execution for write transactions.}

\end{itemize}

%% Version Synopsis
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Version Synopsis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Store a separate column that tracks the position of the first and last versioned tuple in 
    a block of tuples.

    \item
    When scanning tuples, the DBMS can check for strides of tuples without older versions and 
    execute more efficiently.
\end{itemize}

%% SAP HANA
%% ==================================================================
\section{\dbSys{SAP HANA}}
\dbSys{SAP HANA} is an in-memory HTAP DBMS with time-travel version storage (N2O).~\cite{farber2012sap}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supports both optimistic and pessimistic MVCC.
    \item Latest versions are stored in time-travel space.
    \item Hybrid storage layout (row + columnar).
    \item Based on \dbSys{P*TIME}, \dbSys{TREX}, and \dbSys{MaxDB}.
\end{itemize}

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Transaction Validation
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Version Storage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Store the oldest version in the main data table.
    
    \item 
    Each tuple maintains a flag to denote whether there exists newer versions in the version space. 
    
    \item \rr{Maintains a separate hash table that maps the logical record id for the tuple to the head of the version chain. This avoids storing additional metadata about versioning in the main table.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Transactions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Store a pointer to a context object instead of embedding meta-data about the txn that created a version with the data.

    \item
    Store meta-data about whether a txn has committed in a separate object as well.
\end{itemize}

%% ==================================================================
%% CICADA
%% ==================================================================
\section{\dbSys{CMU Cicada}}
In-memory OLTP engine based on optimistic MVCC with append-only storage (N2O)~\cite{p21-lim}.
Designed to be scalable for both low and high contention workloads.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Best-effort in-lining
    \item Loosely Synchronized Clocks
    \item Contention Aware validation
    \item Index Nodes Stored in Tables
\end{itemize}

%% ----------------------------------------------------
%% Best-Effort Inlining
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Best-Effort In-lining}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Record meta-data is stored in a fixed location.
    
    \item
    Threads will attempt to inline read-mostly version within this meta-data to reduce 
    version chain traversals.
\end{itemize}

%% Transaction Validation
%% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Transaction Validation}

TODO: Add intro paragraph to say that Cicada has several optimizations to speed up the validation step in their DBMS.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contention-aware Validation:}
    Validate access to recently modified (high contention) records first. \rr{Instead of comparing transactions' read sets, Cicada tries to reorder them based on their write timestamps. Transactions are written most recently are more likely to have conflicts, so it would be a good idea to check them first.}
    
    \item \textbf{Early Consistency Check:}
    Pre-validated access set before making global writes. \rr{Rather than waiting until the end of a transaction to perform validation, we can preemptively kill transactions that might abort later on.}
    
    \item If the DBMS knows that most of the recently executed transactions committed successfully,
    then it can skip Contention-Aware Validation and Early Consistency check
    
    \item \textbf{Incremental Version Search:}
    Resume from last search location in version list \rr{to improve cache performance}.
\end{itemize}
